## What CMU Talent Hub Does

**CMU Talent Hub** is a verified, secure platform that connects Carnegie Mellon University students with career opportunities, peer collaborations, and businesses. Think LinkedIn meets Upwork, but built exclusively for CMU students.

**Our Solution:**
We solve the critical problem where 73% of talented CMU students struggle to get discovered despite having exceptional skills and projects. Our platform enables students to:

- **Showcase their talents** through rich media portfolios (videos, images, code repositories)
- **Discover opportunities** via advanced search and filtering for internships, jobs, and projects
- **Build professional networks** through verified connections with peers, faculty, and businesses
- **Get discovered** by businesses and faculty actively seeking CMU talent

**For Businesses & Faculty:**
We provide a direct pipeline to CMU's brightest minds, allowing them to:
- Post job opportunities and manage applications
- Browse verified student profiles with detailed portfolios
- Connect directly with students who have the exact skills they need
- Access a curated, quality-assured talent pool

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Verified & Exclusive:** CMU email verification ensures all users are authentic CMU community members
- **Portfolio-First Design:** Purpose-built for showcasing student work, unlike generic professional networks
- **Community-Focused:** Emphasizes long-term network building rather than one-time transactions
- **Mobile & Web:** Cross-platform accessibility via React Native mobile app and Next.js web platform

**Technology:** Built with modern, scalable technologies including AI-powered talent matching, real-time messaging, and secure authentication systems.

**Impact:** We're transforming how students build their careers and how organizations discover talent—turning invisible talent into visible opportunities, one connection at a time.
