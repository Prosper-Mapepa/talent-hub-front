## DELIVERY TIPS FOR SUCCESS

**CLARITY over complexity** – Avoid jargon. Use simple, powerful language that judges can immediately understand.

**PACE YOURSELF** – Practice timing each section. The 10-10-15-10-10-5 second breakdown ensures you cover everything without rushing. Speak at approximately 150 words per minute for perfect timing.

**EMOTIONAL CONNECTION** – Start with Sarah's story to create an immediate emotional hook. Make judges feel the problem before you solve it.

**USE PAUSES** – Pause briefly between sections (0.5-1 second) to let key points sink in, especially after the problem statement and before the solution.

**BODY LANGUAGE** – Maintain eye contact, use hand gestures to emphasize key points, and show passion when discussing the impact.

**PRACTICE OUT LOUD** – Rehearse until the pitch flows naturally. Time yourself to ensure you stay within 60 seconds. Record yourself to check pacing and clarity.

**END WITH CONFIDENCE** – Your call to action should be delivered with conviction. You're not asking for help—you're inviting them to join a movement.

**KEY WORDS TO EMPHASIZE** – "73% struggle," "$200 billion," "exclusive," "verified," "network becomes your net worth"
